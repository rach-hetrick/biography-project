        <h2>Who Was Berthe Morisot?</h2>
        
        <p>When the second Impressionist exhibition opened in the spring of 1876 in Paris, one sharp-tongued critic described its participants as “five or six lunatics, one of which is a woman.” The woman, of course, was Berthe Morisot, who in spite of her gender became a leading figure of the most famous artistic movement of the 19th century. The label of “lunatic,” however, was an aberration. Morisot cultivated her artistic talents and achieved success at an early age with acceptance to the Salon at age 23, and tenaciously held on to her rank at the forefront of French painters until her death 30 years later.
        </p>
      
      <p>Though frequently self-critical of her own work, and barred by social conventions from pursuing the same subject matter as her male counterparts, Morisot nonetheless developed the connections and familial support that enabled her to carve out her own independent career as an artist for more than three decades and leave a permanent mark on the direction of French art.</p>
